0.42 Thu Feb 18 10:13:11 PST 2010

* Inline uri_unescape to drop URI::Escape which is the only non-core
  dependency of this distribution. -- miyagawa

* Do not special case COOKIE and sets Cookie header to HTTP_COOKIE. -- miyagawa

  O'Reilly's WebSite server misuses COOKIE environment instead of
  HTTP_COOKIE. We don't need to replicate that bug since
  HTTP::Server::Simple is a server, not a CGI library like CGI.pm.

0.32 Thu Apr 24 09:45:14 EDT 2008

* At least Apache and lighttpd put unencoded strings into PATH_INFO, so so should we.

* Patch from ntyni@iki.fi to make backgrounding of the standalone server's server process deterministic. [rt.cpan.org #28122]

0.31 Sun Mar 16 20:51:04 EDT 2008

* Test suite parallelization fixes. Thanks to Slaven Rezic

0.30 Tue Mar 11 12:14:24 EDT 2008

* Minor doc fix from Paul Miller. 
* Fixing doc style from "$this" to "$self" like any self-respecting perl code

0.29 Fri Feb 15 11:43:29 EST 2008

* new example section from almut on perlmonks

0.28 Tue Jan 15 09:33:58 EST 2008
 * New restartability support from Mark Stosberg

    After reviewing the code in HTTP::Server::Simple,
    Catalyst::Engine::HTTP and HTTP::Server::Brick, I found and
    implemented an updated signal handling approach that I like and
    understand, and actually works.

    The current code restarted immediately if a SIGHUP came in, no
    matter what was happening, including if a request was in process of
    being fulfilled.

    The new code works more like "apachectl graceful". It waits for the
    current request cycle to finish, and then restarts the server.

    This code has to be integrated in the core, but its just about
    the same amount of signal handling code that was there... it just
    works better.  It's also written in such a way I think subclass/mixin
    authors could rewrite just these parts if they wanted.

    Also, it looks like a Net::Server based sub-class would already be
    doing its own thing with SIGHUP handling, and should continue to
    be unaffected.

0.27

 * 0.26 release apparently didn't get to cpan correctly

0.26
 
  * Supports multi-line encoded values in query_sting (like foo%0Abar) -- Dobrica Pavlinusic 
  * Fixes to URI unescaping to behave like apache does
0.24

  * Hopefully deal with an odd case where a poorly behaved Internet Explorer could crash the server.
    Thanks to the Catalyst project.

0.23
  Fix a release-engineering messup. Thanks to ANDK


0.22 Wed Oct 18 23:36:34 EDT 2006

   [rt.cpan.org #21727] [PATCH] Support for Perl 5.004
    -- SÃ©bastien Aperghis-Tramoni 

0.19

  Catch and ignore SIGPIPE, so broken pipes from the client don't cause 
  Standalone to drop all the way back to the shell.

0.20

  Require POSIX only if we need it, rather than "use" it all the time
  [cpan #17533] - Brad Bowman

0.18

  new method: valid_http_method() from Chris Dent to make it easier to 
  create servers handling non-standard HTTP verbs.

0.17
  Workaround for Class::Spiffy classloading order issue
  Better handling for completely mangled requests.

0.16 Mon Nov  7 14:40:43 EST 2005

  Precompute the local host's hostname and IP to save on DNS lookups at runtime 

0.14 Thu Oct  6 20:48:49 EDT 2005

  Split out HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI::Environment to support non-CGI.pm CGIs
  Ignore SIGPIPE
  
  Signal handlers are now installed on ->run, not on new. Also, they're 
  documented. Thanks to Mark Fowler.
 
  We no longer lookup $ENV{'REMOTE_HOST'} by hostname, as it can cause huge performance problems.

0.13 Tue Aug  9 21:25:20 EDT 2005

  Signal handlers should be 'localed', so as not to mess with others' 
  code. -- Thanks to David Wheeler
