0.42 2010-02-18T10:13:11Z
 - Inline uri_unescape to drop URI::Escape which is the only non-core
   dependency of this distribution. -- miyagawa
 - Do not special case COOKIE and sets Cookie header to HTTP_COOKIE. --
   miyagawa O'Reilly's WebSite server misuses COOKIE environment instead of
   HTTP_COOKIE. We don't need to replicate that bug since
   HTTP::Server::Simple is a server, not a CGI library like CGI.pm.

0.33 2008-04-25T13:57:30Z

   quite work right for some apps using HSS. It's been reverted for now and
   the tests TODOED

   server process deterministic. [rt.cpan.org #28122]

 - Fixing doc style from "$this" to "$self" like any self-respecting perl
   code

0.29 2008-02-15T11:43:29Z
 - new example section from almut on perlmonks

0.28 2008-01-15T09:33:58Z
 - New restartability support from Mark Stosberg After reviewing the code
   in HTTP::Server::Simple, Catalyst::Engine::HTTP and HTTP::Server::Brick,
   I found and implemented an updated signal handling approach that I like
   and understand, and actually works. The current code restarted
   immediately if a SIGHUP came in, no matter what was happening, including
   if a request was in process of being fulfilled. The new code works more
   like "apachectl graceful". It waits for the current request cycle to
   finish, and then restarts the server. This code has to be integrated in
   the core, but its just about the same amount of signal handling code
   that was there... it just works better.  It's also written in such a way
   I think subclass/mixin authors could rewrite just these parts if they
   wanted. Also, it looks like a Net::Server based sub-class would already
   be doing its own thing with SIGHUP handling, and should continue to be
   unaffected.

0.27

   could crash the server. Thanks to the Catalyst project.

 - create servers handling non-standard HTTP verbs.

   huge performance problems.

0.13 2005-08-09T21:25:20Z
 - Signal handlers should be 'localed', so as not to mess with others' 
 - code. -- Thanks to David Wheeler

   default ->run() method. -- Autrijus Tang
